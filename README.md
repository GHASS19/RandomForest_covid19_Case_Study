# Random Forest Covid 19

In this case study, you'll use Random Forest to understand the scope of the Coronavirus using data from December and January of 2020. This case
study is an excellent example of how data scientists can help share crucial insights about occurrences that have an impact around the world.

## 1. Explore the Data
## 2. Data Wrangling
- What to do with missing values? Mode & Mean
## 3. Visualizations of the Data

- Heatmap of the all the variables for the Covid 19 Data from South Korea

## 4. Random Forest Modeling

- Train/Test Split
- Acuracy & F1 Score:
- Random Forest: Accuracy=0.865
- Random Forest: f1-score=0.832
- Our model was very good at predicting if a patient was released.
